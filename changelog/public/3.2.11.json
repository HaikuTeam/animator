    "What's new": [
      "Origin! You can now control elements' origin of rotation and scale. Hold down 'Command' and drag the crosshairs.",
      "Multi-select! You can now select multiple elements on stage to move or delete them. (Coming soon: multi-rotation and multi-scale.)",
      "Better z-ordering! You can now drag and drop elements in the timeline to change the z-stacking of layers on stage.",
      "Lottie export now supports polyline elements and implicitly closed shapes.",
      "You can now subscribe to custom events within the Actions panel (in addition to all the standard DOM events).",
      "The Haiku Core API now provides support for querying elements programmatically, making Expressions and Actions more powerful. See https://docs.haiku.ai for details.",
      "Made the Action UI clearer and improved the flow for creating new actions.",
      "The Action code editor now displays some code snippets with docs as you type.",
      "When you add a new property to an element in the Timeline, the group it belongs to now automatically expands.",
      "New projects are now private by default. An option to make them public is available when you click the 'Publish' button.",
      "Improved documentation of classes and methods in Haiku Core.",
      "Fixed bug with mobile layout on the Share Page.",
      "Increased the maximum limit for projects â€” Haiku accounts can now create up to 50 projects."

    "Fixes": [

      "Fixed a bug that prevented individual changes from being registered as separate Git commits.",
      "Fixed a performance regression introduced in the last release. Elements on stage can be moved/transformed smoothly again.",
      "Fixed a bug that prevented the ability of some SVG files to be transformed on stage.",
      "Fixed a bug preventing code snippets in the Publish panel from being copied to your clipboard.",
      "Improved error handling so that rapidly occurring errors don't overwhelm the application.",
      "Improved error handling so that error reports are now transmitted more reliably if the app crashes.",
      "Fixed $user.mouse.x and $user.mouse.y position calculations to account for the stage zoom factor.",
      "Improved the reliability of Sketch installation detection, so fewer users receive the prompt to install."
