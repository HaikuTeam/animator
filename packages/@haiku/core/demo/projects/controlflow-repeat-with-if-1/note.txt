There should be two sets of elements. The top set should have 6 elements; it should move from left to right over 1s and disappear for a split second before reappearing. The bottom set should have 5 components with the same visuals as the other controlflow-repeat-* demos; it should move from up to down with an elastic curve; it should start out invisible, then become visible, then invisible, then finally visible as it finishes its animation.
