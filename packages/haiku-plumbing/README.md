# haiku-plumbing

The Haiku plumbing is the integration of all the inner workings that run the Haiku platform on a user's workstation (distinguished from our services which run in the cloud). It includes process management, serialization, synchronization, and remote service calls. It is reponsible for actually carrying out the user-actions invoked either via the GUI ("creator") or the CLI, including launching those interfaces.
